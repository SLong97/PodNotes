# PodNotes

Podcasts are a popular and convenient way for people to access information and entertainment. However, their audio-only format can make them difficult for listeners to fully absorb and retain. 
To address these challenges, my research aimed to develop a system that uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to create transcripts and summaries of podcasts. 
By providing a written version of the audio content, listeners would be able to refer back to specific points in the podcast and more easily retain the information presented.
